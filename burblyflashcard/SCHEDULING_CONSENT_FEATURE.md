# Scheduling Consent Feature

## Overview

The Scheduling Consent Feature provides users with transparency and control over how their study feedback affects card scheduling. After completing a study session, users are shown a beautifully designed, animated popup that displays the proposed schedule changes based on their study performance, and they can choose to accept or decline these changes.

## How It Works

### 1. Study Session Flow
- During a study session, when users rate cards (Again, Hard, Good, Easy), the system calculates the proposed new intervals and ease factors but does not immediately apply them
- Study results are stored temporarily in memory until the session is complete

### 2. Enhanced Consent Dialog
After completing a study session, users see an elegant, animated dialog that shows:

#### üé® **Visual Design Features**
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in, slide-up, and scale animations for a polished feel
- **Modern Design**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and gradient backgrounds
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes with proper constraints
- **Color-Coded Elements**: Intuitive color scheme for different types of changes

#### üìä **Summary Section**
- **Cards to Review Soon**: Cards scheduled for review within 7 days
- **Cards Advanced**: Cards with increased intervals (easier cards)
- **Cards Reset**: Cards reset to learning phase (failed cards)
- **Cards Reduced**: Cards with decreased intervals (difficult cards)

Each summary card features:
- Large, prominent count numbers
- Descriptive subtitles
- Color-coded backgrounds and borders
- Intuitive icons

#### üìã **Detailed Changes**
- Individual card-by-card breakdown showing:
  - Card question (truncated if too long)
  - Type of change (reset, reduced, advanced, normal)
  - Visual indicator of interval change (old ‚Üí new)
  - Color-coded icons and text for easy understanding
  - Subtle background colors and borders for each item

#### üí° **Information Box**
- Gradient background with helpful context
- Clear explanation of what happens next
- Prominent call-to-action guidance

### 3. User Choice
- **Accept & Schedule**: Applies all calculated changes to card intervals and ease factors
- **Decline**: Keeps current card intervals unchanged, only updates study statistics

## Benefits

### üéØ **Transparency**
- Users can see exactly how their study performance affects future review schedules
- Clear visual representation of interval changes
