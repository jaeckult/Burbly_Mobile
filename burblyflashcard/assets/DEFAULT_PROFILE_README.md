# Default Profile Picture

This file should contain a 120x120 pixel PNG image that serves as the fallback profile picture.

## Image Specifications:
- **Size**: 120x120 pixels
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Design**: Simple, clean circular avatar with:
  - Light gray background circle (#E0E0E0)
  - Darker gray person silhouette in the center (#9E9E9E)
  - Professional appearance suitable for all users

## Alternative Options:
1. **Create manually** using any image editing software
2. **Use online tools** like Canva, Figma, or similar
3. **Download a free avatar** from sites like:
   - Flaticon
   - Icons8
   - Feather Icons
   - Material Design Icons

## Implementation Notes:
- The app will automatically fall back to this image when no profile picture is available
- The image should be lightweight (< 50KB) for fast loading
- Consider creating multiple sizes for different display contexts

## Current Fallback:
Until this image is created, the app will show a person icon (Icons.person) as the fallback.
