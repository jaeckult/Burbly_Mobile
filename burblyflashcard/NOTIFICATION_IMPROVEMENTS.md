### 2. Android Notification Channels
- ✅ Added proper Android notification channel creation
- ✅ Created separate channels for different notification types:
  - Daily Study Reminders
  - Overdue Cards
  - Study Streaks
  - Immediate Notifications
- ✅ Added proper channel descriptions and importance levels

### 3. Notification Permissions
- ✅ Added `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission for Android 13+

## How It Works Now

### Daily Reminders
1. User sets preferred time and days for study reminders
2. System schedules notifications for each selected day
3. Notifications are automatically rescheduled if needed
4. Reminders appear at the exact time specified

### Overdue Cards
1. Background service checks for overdue cards every 30 minutes
2. If overdue cards exist, schedules a reminder notification
3. Prevents duplicate notifications within 2 hours
4. Shows count of overdue cards in notification

### Study Streaks
1. Tracks consecutive study days
2. Celebrates streaks of 3+ days
3. Prevents duplicate celebrations on the same day
4. Motivates users to maintain consistency

## Technical Improvements

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Added logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when notifications fail
- App continues to work even if notification service fails

### Performance
- Reduced background service frequency from hourly to every 30 minutes
- Added duplicate notification prevention
- Optimized notification scheduling logic
- Better memory management

### Reliability
- Proper Android channel setup
- Boot completion handling
- Permission checking and requesting
- Automatic rescheduling of notifications

## Testing

To test the notification system:

1. **Enable notifications** in device settings
2. **Set daily reminders** with specific time and days
3. **Create flashcards** and study them to trigger spaced repetition
4. **Check background service** logs for notification scheduling
5. **Verify notifications** appear at scheduled times

## Debug Mode

For development purposes, you can call:
```dart
await NotificationService().testNotification();
```

This will send a test notification to verify the system is working.

## Future Enhancements

- Add notification history
- Add custom notification sounds
- Add notification grouping
- Add notification actions (e.g., "Start Studying" button)
- Add notification preferences per deck
- Add smart notification timing based on user behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not appearing**
   - Check device notification permissions
   - Verify notification channels are created
   - Check background service is running
   - Review logs for scheduling errors

2. **Daily reminders not working**
   - Verify time and days are set correctly
   - Check if notifications are enabled
   - Restart the app to reinitialize services

3. **Overdue cards not detected**
   - Ensure cards have `nextReview` dates set
   - Check background service frequency
   - Verify overdue reminders are enabled

### Logs to Check

- Notification service initialization
- Daily reminder scheduling
- Overdue cards detection
- Background service execution
- Permission requests and results

## Conclusion

The notification system has been significantly improved to provide reliable, user-friendly reminders for studying flashcards. The system now properly integrates with Android's notification framework, handles errors gracefully, and provides a better user experience with statistics and helpful information.
